Brief Statement
Animated GIFs and image memes have very few analogues in the pre-internet world. Flickering cave paintings and memetic symbols like the ichthys and rainbow flag give tantalizing glimpses to a future of rapidly spreading images. And while science fiction is filled with predictions of a rich communications medium that exists in networked and mobile space, no one could predict the rise of the LOLCat, Autotunes and the Hamster dance. These addictive, viral, remixed media were birthed from and belong to the internet generation.

Borrowing from the aspirational idea of Indianapolis as a “Crossroads of America”, We Meme is a project that seeks to explore the internet as a site for the cross pollination of visual culture online. Unbound by words, image memes take on a life of their own online and often leap across linguistic and cultural barriers and technical firewalls. One could say they are of the internet, birthed from the unique crossroads of online cultures and belonging to a broader internet culture.

It was installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art for the Global Spaces exhibition curated by Ben Valentine.

Technical Specifics
This package contains two components:

1. A web site simulation of the exhibition format, juxtaposing animated GIFs from China and the US together. The GIFs were curated and served up by different guest contributors. It refreshes every few seconds. This does not (yet) contain the image silhouettes I designed to give the web site a sense of scale.
2. Individual pages that just showed the GIFs and were projected directly into the physical space at the museum.

WeMeme is lovingly developed in Python, HTML and a wee bit of Javascript, working directly with Tumblr's API, and served up on the Flask microframework.  It's open source, have fun!
